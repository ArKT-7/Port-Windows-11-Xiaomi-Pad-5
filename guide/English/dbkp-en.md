# Running Windows on the Xiaomi Pad 5

## Dualboot guide (DualbootKernelPatcher)
> There are two methods listed below, the first one requires root, the second one does not. Use whichever method suits you the most, as they both do the same.

### Prerequisites (method 1: root required)
- [WOA Helper app](https://github.com/n00b69/woa-helper/releases/tag/APK)

### Setup - Android
- Download and install the **WOA Helper** app, then open it and grant it root access.
- Open **WOA Toolbox**, then press the **DUALBOOT KERNEL PATCHER** button and select the option you would like to use (dualboot using the **magnetic case**, or with **volume buttons**).
- Wait for it to finish, then reboot your device.

#### Booting into Windows - Magnetic Case method
- Close the **magnetic case** and reboot (or turn on) your device.

#### Booting into Windows - Volume button method
- Reboot (or turn on) your device and hold any **volume button** once you see the unlock icon or the Aloha logo (upside down V).

#### Booting into Android
- Open the **magnetic case** and reboot (or turn on) your device.
- If you are using the **volume button** method, simply do not press any volume button while (re)booting the device.
